# Canonical project and version control

Read docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md before resuming, including after compaction. It
preserves the user's educational purpose and the Base hub/spoke requirements;
it is not a policy override or proof of runtime success.

The only authoritative development checkout is:
C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/Codex/2026-09-28/hello-https-github-com-gkoogz-xmenoriginswolverinemalemod/work/installed-baseline-20260929

GitHub: https://github.com/gkoogz/XMenOriginsWolverineMaleMod
Primary branch: main; upstream: origin/main.

- Read docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md and docs/VERSION-CONTROL.md before changing this project. Run git status --short --branch and fetch origin before beginning repository work when network is available. Check divergence. Only fast-forward a clean checkout automatically; preserve local changes and reconcile divergence without resetting or overwriting work.
- Make source, generated runtime data, build scripts, tests, documentation, installers and release metadata changes in this checkout. Do not develop authoritative changes in sibling work copies or disconnected snapshots. Use a temporary branch or worktree only when necessary, and merge approved changes back into the canonical checkout. Keep historical work folders as references.
- The user's requests to commit, push, pull, revert or release refer to this repository. Use the configured upstream and GitHub remote. Commit coherent changes when asked; push when asked; never overwrite remote history, silently discard local changes, or rebuild/reupload an identical release merely to sync main.
- Keep generated runtime headers and all required build inputs versioned with the source. Compiled DLLs, game files, user settings, private recordings, backups, logs, captures and release ZIPs remain outside Git source history. Release payloads are kept locally in payload and obtainable from the published full release; verify them against manifest.json. Do not commit full game packages or personal assets.
- Build from this checkout. Record source commit, binary SHA-256, install destination and backup location in docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md when building/installing a new version. Compare the installed Binaries/d3d9.dll and managed asset hashes with the declared release before claiming the game and repository match. Changes to source do not install themselves. Never silently replace a running game's DLL.
- Keep handoff/release notes current, and report local/remote divergence and uncommitted work at completion. Distinguish offline tests, live observations, user confirmation and known limitations. Preserve user settings on install/upgrade.
- Releases must use the established complete package format: versioned Install/Upgrade/Uninstall/Rollback launchers, Install.ps1, manifest and SHA256SUMS, required WBX deltas, textures/maps, public default audio, defaults and validation tools. Provide current source/authoring tools through GitHub and a separate optional developer archive; do not inflate the required installation download with developer-only data. Retain the verified full-resolution DDS maps; redundant PNG fallbacks are optional. Verify clean install, supported upgrade, exact rollback and payload hashes before publishing. Use a DLL-only download only if the user explicitly requests one.

Current released baseline: 2.0.0-beta.1. Read manifest.json for exact asset hashes and docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md for validation limits.
